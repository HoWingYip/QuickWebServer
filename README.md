# QuickWebServer #

An electron app that just lets you serve static files from as many directories on your PC as you wish.

Many more features are planned for future releases such as

- start on startup
- remembering what directories you served previously
- UI overhaul
- actually reducing the app size!

- WRITING AN EQUIVALENT APP IN C# SO I DON'T DISTRIBUTE A 100 MB ZIP FILE...
